# Contributing

Like most open source projects, this list exists because of contributors like yourself. ðŸ’–<br>
I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to further this list, and also for checking the contributing policy.

You can find project setup, build and deploy instructions in the [README](./README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn more about contributing to open source at [Git-In](https://github.com/Lissy93/git-in)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> - If you're updating the checklist, the only file you need to update is `personal-security-checklist.yml`. DO NOT edit the markdown or website content directly, as this will be overridden on the next build.
> - When submitting your pull request, provide references backing up any information that you're adding/amending/removing.
> - Please ensure you've followed our [code of conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), that is adapted from [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
> - If you're adding or deleting something major, you should consider opening an issue first to discuss it.

> [!WARNING]
> Users submitting PRs, issues or comments which are either obviously spam or activley offensive **will be reported**
